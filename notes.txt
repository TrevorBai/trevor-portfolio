"node": "10.16.3",  // node -v to check current node version
"npm": "6.9.0"      // npm -v to check current npm version

node version and npm version is critical. If we update node version to newer one
such as latest one, it would possiblly force npm version to be updated to a newer version.
If you JUST switch node version to a newer one using nvm, then you check npm version,
you would get error possiblly because your npm version is too old to use as current node version.

And json doesn't allow comments, so I would create a dummy notes file.
